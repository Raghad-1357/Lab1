# Lab1
This lab session covers the usage of the Wireshark application to monitor and capture the outgoing and incoming packets from a network connection (WIFI, ethernet, etc.). Specifically, students should be able to analyze HTTP, HTTPS, TCP/IP, and UDP protocols using Wireshark, a network protocol analyzer, and draw conclusions.
